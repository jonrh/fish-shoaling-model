# Python_Practice
Practice on agent-based modelling using the Mesa framework for Python. There are three seperate exersizes included.

1) MoneyModelMoney: the completed introductory tutorial from Mesa, a model of a simple agent-based economy. There is a Jupyter notebook with the entire tutorial and a Python file with all of the code documented for future reference.

2) The Flocking example of collective behaviour from Mesa. The code for this example is included as both a Jupyter notebook and Python code. Also includes a JavaScript file that sets up a HTML5 canvas for visualization of a simple, continuous canvas.

3) Preliminary attempts to adapt the boids model for a model of fish shoaling behaviour. There is the start of an adaptation of the Flocker example that is based on a model of satisfaction outlined by Quera et al. 2015, and a preliminary shoaling model that adds data collection and attempts to create a 3-dimensional space.
